Within the domain of social fear learning, galvanic skin response (GSR) stands as a reliable physiological marker of learned fear (Blechert et al., 2007; J. E. Dunsmoor et al., 2009; Ganella et al., 2017). When participants perceive a highly emotionally arousing event, such as the presentation of a CS+ stimulus, the amygdala activation and sympathetic nervous system modulation result in increased sweat gland secretion, elevating skin conductivity and amplifying electrodermal activity.



Moreover, previous investigations have revealed that viewing fearful faces engenders a significant surge in electrodermal conductivity (Ellena et al., 2020; Fusar-Poli et al., 2009; Lapate et al., 2014). Building upon this evidence, our study seeks to further scrutinize whether fear learning mediated by eye gaze cues elicits distinctive electrocortical indicators. Additionally, we intend to incorporate subjective ratings to directly quantify the impact of fear learning, exploring the capacity of eye gaze cues to transmit fear-related emotional attributes from both subjective and physiological perspectives.
