  Musicians were found to outperform others in visuospatial working memory
  tasks. However, it remains unclear whether finger movement experience is
  linked to this phenomenon. This study examined the enhancement effect of
  finger movement on visuospatial working memory from both correlational and
  experimental perspectives. In

  Experiment 1, visuospatial working memory was compared among science undergraduates (n = 27), liberal arts undergraduates (n = 27) and experienced instrumentalists (n = 29). The result showed that after controlling fluid intelligence statistically, instrumentalists with long-term finger movement experience performed better in visuospatial working memory task than others. In Experiment 2, 67 non-musical undergraduates were randomly assigned into two groups. In the experimental group (n = 34), participants took part in a short-term finger movement practice. The results showed that participants with the assistance of finger movement responded more accurately in spatial delayed match-to-sample task than those without assistance of finger movement. In conclusion, the enhancement effect of finger movement on visuospatial working memory was supported from both long-term instrumental training and short-term finger
