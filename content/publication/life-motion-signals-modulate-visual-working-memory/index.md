abstract: Previous research has demonstrated that biological motion (BM) cues
  can induce a reflexive attentional orienting effect, a phenomenon referred to
  as social attention. However, it remains undetermined whether BM cues can
  further affect higher-order cognitive processes, such as visual working memory
  (WM). By combining a modified central pre-cueing paradigm with a traditional
  WM change detection task, the current study investigated whether the walking
  direction of BM, as a non-predictive central cue, could modulate the encoding
  process of WM. Results revealed a significant improvement in WM performance
  for the items appearing at the location cued by the walking direction of BM.
  The observed effect disappeared when the BM cues were shown inverted, or when
  the critical biological characteristics of the cues were removed. Crucially,
  this effect could be extended to upright feet motion cues without global
  configuration, reflecting the key role of local BM signals in modulating WM.
  More importantly, such a BM-induced modulation effect was not observed with
  inanimate motion cues, although these cues can also elicit attentional
  effects. Our findings suggest that the attentional effect induced by life
  motion signals can penetrate to higher-order cognitive processes, and provide
  compelling evidence for the existence of “life motion detector” in the human
  brain from a high-level cognitive function perspective.
