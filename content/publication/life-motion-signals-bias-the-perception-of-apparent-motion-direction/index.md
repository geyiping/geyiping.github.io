  Walking direction conveyed by biological motion (BM) cues, which humans are
  highly sensitive to since birth, can elicit involuntary shifts of attention to
  enhance the detection of static targets. Here, we demonstrated that such
  intrinsic sensitivity to walking direction could also modulate the direction
  perception of simultaneously presented dynamic stimuli. We showed that the
  perceived direction of apparent motion was biased towards the walking
  direction even though observers had been informed in advance that the walking
  direction of BM did not predict the apparent motion direction. In particular,
  rightward BM cues had an advantage over leftward BM cues in altering the
  perception of motion direction. Intriguingly, this perceptual bias disappeared
  when BM cues were shown inverted, or when the critical biological
  characteristics were removed from the cues. Critically, both the perceptual
  direction bias and the rightward advantage persisted even when only local BM
  cues were presented without any global configuration. Furthermore, the
  rightward advantage was found to be specific to social cues (i.e., BM), as it
  vanished when non-social cues (i.e., arrows) were utilized. Taken together,
  these findings support the existence of a specific processing mechanism for
  life motion signals and shed new light on their influences in a dynamic
  environment.
