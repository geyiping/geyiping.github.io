abstract: About three thousand valid questionnaires were collected online in
  non-Hubei regions to investigate the relationships among epidemic exposure,
  meaning-focused coping strategies and interpersonal conflicts during the
  COVID-19 outbreak. Results showed that interpersonal conflicts were positively
  correlated with the degree of individual epidemic exposure. Compared with
  others, residents lived in low-risk areas with high individual exposure were
  more likely to be involved in interpersonal conflicts. Furthermore, the
  meaning-focused coping played a significant moderating role during this
  process. It was found that among people with low epidemic exposure, the
  negative impact of epidemic exposure can be significantly reduced by adopting
  meaning-focused coping strategies.
