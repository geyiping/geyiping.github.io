  There is emerging evidence showing a psychological link between physical
  warmth and the 

  perception of interpersonal proximity. However, it is not clear whether such a link can be generalized 

  to overt behaviours. The present study examined whether physical warmth is associated with 

  interpersonal proximity in perceptions and behaviours and explored the role of attachment in 

  predicting the results of warmth priming. A total of 105 undergraduates completed a perceptual

  focus task and a step-stop task successively. The results showed that in the warm condition (vs. in 

  the cold condition), participants exhibited closer interpersonal proximity in both perceptions and 

  overt behaviours. However, the relation was significant only among participants characterized by

  insecure attachment with high anxiety. In conclusion, the link between physical warmth and 

  interpersonal proximity is moderated by attachment.
