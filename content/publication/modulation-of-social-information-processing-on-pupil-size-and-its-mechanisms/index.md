abstract: "Pupil size, as a window into the minds of others, plays a crucial
  role in social interaction. While previous studies have focused on the
  influence of non-social factors, such as the physical properties of stimuli,
  on pupil diameter, recent research has emphasized the significant connection
  between social information processing and pupil size. In this comprehensive
  review, we aim to explore how the processing of social stimuli (e.g., face,
  biological motion) and their emotional characteristics affect pupil size. In
  essence, pupil size is believed to reflect an individual's perception of
  social stimuli. It goes beyond simple physical properties and encompasses the
  processing of complex social information, including social contexts and
  interactions. The modulation of pupil size in response to social stimuli is
  believed to be driven by two key mechanisms: emotional arousal and social
  attention. When individuals encounter emotionally charged social cues, their
  pupils tend to dilate, indicating heightened emotional engagement. Similarly,
  the dilation of pupils when individuals focus on specific social cues suggests
  an increased allocation of cognitive resources to process relevant social
  information. Furthermore, the connection between pupil size and social
  information processing has provided intriguing findings in individuals with
  autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Known for their significant social deficits,
  individuals with ASD exhibited abnormal pupillary responses when presented
  with social stimuli. These findings raise the possibility of utilizing
  pupillary responses as a potential index for identifying individuals with ASD
  at a relatively younger age. Moreover, the incorporation of pupillary response
  measurements in the diagnosis holds great promise in transcending the
  limitations of the minimum diagnostic age. This can have important
  implications both in terms of theoretical understanding and practical
  applications related to the diagnosis and intervention of ASD."
