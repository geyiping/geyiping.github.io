While previous studies have focused on the influence of non-social factors, such as the physical properties of stimuli, on pupil diameter, recent research has emphasized the significant connection between social information processing and pupil size. In this comprehensive review, we aim to explore how the processing of social stimuli (e.g., face, biological motion) and their emotional characteristics affect pupil size. In essence, pupil size is believed to reflect an individual's perception of social stimuli. It goes beyond simple physical properties and encompasses the processing of complex social information, including social contexts and interactions. The modulation of pupil size in response to social stimuli is believed to be driven by two key mechanisms: emotional arousal and social attention. When individuals encounter emotionally charged social cues, their pupils tend to dilate, indicating heightened emotional engagement. Similarly, the dilation of pupils when individuals focus on specific social cues suggests an increased allocation of cognitive resources to process relevant social information. Furthermore, the connection between pupil size and social information processing has provided intriguing findings in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Known for their significant social deficits, individuals with ASD exhibited abnormal pupillary responses when presented with social stimuli. These findings raise the possibility of utilizing pupillary responses as a potential index for identifying individuals with ASD at a relatively younger age. Moreover, the incorporation of pupillary response measurements in the diagnosis holds great promise in transcending the limitations of the minimum diagnostic age. This can have important implications both in terms of theoretical understanding and practical applications related to the diagnosis and intervention of ASD.","tags":["Pupil size","Social information processing","Social stimuli","Emotion","Autism"],"title":"Modulation of social information processing on pupil size and its mechanisms (in Chinese)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yiping Ge","Li Wang*","Yi Jiang"],"categories":null,"content":"Within the domain of social fear learning, galvanic skin response (GSR) stands as a reliable physiological marker of learned fear (Blechert et al., 2007; J. E. Dunsmoor et al., 2009; Ganella et al., 2017). When participants perceive a highly emotionally arousing event, such as the presentation of a CS+ stimulus, the amygdala activation and sympathetic nervous system modulation result in increased sweat gland secretion, elevating skin conductivity and amplifying electrodermal activity.\nMoreover, previous investigations have revealed that viewing fearful faces engenders a significant surge in electrodermal conductivity (Ellena et al., 2020; Fusar-Poli et al., 2009; Lapate et al., 2014). Building upon this evidence, our study seeks to further scrutinize whether fear learning mediated by eye gaze cues elicits distinctive electrocortical indicators. Additionally, we intend to incorporate subjective ratings to directly quantify the impact of fear learning, exploring the capacity of eye gaze cues to transmit fear-related emotional attributes from both subjective and physiological perspectives.\n","date":1694496922,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694496922,"objectID":"9a2b118c14bce9214cfe86c95c14b4ea","permalink":"https://geyiping.github.io/project/physiological-evidence-for-gaze-mediated-fear-transmission-eda-and-pupillometry-study/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T05:35:22.825Z","relpermalink":"/project/physiological-evidence-for-gaze-mediated-fear-transmission-eda-and-pupillometry-study/","section":"project","summary":"This study seeks to further scrutinize whether fear learning mediated by eye gaze elicits distinctive physiological responses.","tags":null,"title":"Physiological evidence for gaze-mediated fear transmission (EDA and pupillometry study)","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yiping Ge","Li Wang*","Yi Jiang"],"categories":null,"content":"Both inherent fear attributes and newly acquired fear information have been found to affect time perception, inducing a time extension effect. Building upon the foundation of previous studies (Bar-Haim et al., 2010; Grommet et al., 2011; Tipples, 2008; Fayolle et al., 2015; Kliegl et al., 2015), this study aims to explore whether fear learning mediated by eye gaze can similarly influence perceptual processing, specifically, perception of temporal duration. Additionally, considering the importance of intention transmission in processing eye gaze cues, we also investigate whether socially relevant autistic traits, linked to impaired intention processing (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001), modulate gaze-mediated fear learning.\nThis study employs a “three-phase” experimental paradigm. During the intermediate learning phase, fear transmission toward previously neutral cartoon faces via gaze cues was conducted using a modified central cue paradigm. Pre- and post-tests utilized time perception tasks to examine whether the fearful attributes conveyed by eye gaze during intermediate learning led to changes in individual subjective temporal perception.\nIn particular, Exp.1 explored whether gaze-mediated fear transmission biases subjective perception of temporal duration, and whether there exists a modulating role of autistic traits. In Exp. 2, a novel cartoon face stimuli was introduced as a control to investigate whether the effect of gaze-mediated fear learning on time perception, if observed, is more attributed to fearful gaze association rather than non-association. In Exp. 3, the baffle images were introduced to obstruct gaze cues from ‘seeing’ cartoon faces to explore whether such effects are influenced by perception of intention conveyance. （The picture on this page comes from the Internet）\n","date":1694494495,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694494495,"objectID":"0f9ecf8f6888ba4f955af828f37a10c9","permalink":"https://geyiping.github.io/project/gaze-mediated-fear-transmission-modulates-perception-of-temporal-duration/","publishdate":"2023-09-12T04:54:55.255Z","relpermalink":"/project/gaze-mediated-fear-transmission-modulates-perception-of-temporal-duration/","section":"project","summary":"This study aims to explore whether fear learning mediated by eye gaze can further influence perceptual processing, specifically, perception of temporal duration.

However, it remains undetermined whether BM cues can further affect higher-order cognitive processes, such as visual working memory (WM). By combining a modified central pre-cueing paradigm with a traditional WM change detection task, the current study investigated whether the walking direction of BM, as a non-predictive central cue, could modulate the encoding process of WM. Results revealed a significant improvement in WM performance for the items appearing at the location cued by the walking direction of BM. The observed effect disappeared when the BM cues were shown inverted, or when the critical biological characteristics of the cues were removed. Crucially, this effect could be extended to upright feet motion cues without global configuration, reflecting the key role of local BM signals in modulating WM. More importantly, such a BM-induced modulation effect was not observed with inanimate motion cues, although these cues can also elicit attentional effects. Our findings suggest that the attentional effect induced by life motion signals can penetrate to higher-order cognitive processes, and provide compelling evidence for the existence of “life motion detector” in the human brain from a high-level cognitive function perspective.","tags":null,"title":"Life motion signals modulate visual working memory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yiping Ge","Tian Yuan","Xinyi Huang","Li Wang*","Yi Jiang"],"categories":null,"content":"The pivotal role of eye gaze as a fundamental social cue is distinctly evident within the framework of social fear acquisition.

By employing a novel gaze-associated learning paradigm in conjunction with affective priming tasks, we showed that fearful-gaze-associated cartoon faces induced a discernible negative shift in affective dispositions compared with those associated with the non-fearful gaze. Notably, this fear transmission was not attributed to general attentional allocation or driven by low-level visual information, since it disappeared under conditions of gaze inversion. Critically, the gaze-mediated fear transmission vanished when cues were obstructed by baffles, implying the key role of intention processing elicited by eye gaze during the fear acquisition. Moreover, invisible gaze cues could also mediate and impose fear properties onto previously neutral cartoon faces, which suggests that gaze-mediated fear transmission exists even without conscious awareness. In summary, our findings emphasize the profound social implications of eye gaze and shed new light on the nuanced dynamics of affective attitude acquisition and calibration in interpersonal interactions.\n","date":1694266772,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694266772,"objectID":"7ffb6fe52034d50af5eb738d8d198e51","permalink":"https://geyiping.github.io/project/gaze1/","publishdate":"2023-09-09T13:39:32.888Z","relpermalink":"/project/gaze1/","section":"project","summary":"The pivotal role of eye gaze as a fundamental social cue is distinctly evident within the framework of social fear acquisition.
